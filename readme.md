# A Guessing Game

We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

### Prerequisites:
1. Rust
2. IDE of your choice


To be able to run this program:
1. use `git clone`  to the clone this project in your local
2. Now `cd` into this folder .
3. Type the following command in terminal `rust build`
4. Run the project using `rust run`.
